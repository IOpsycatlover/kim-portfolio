    <h3>Going to graduate school for Industrial/Organizational Psychology is my goal.</h3>
    <p>
      <br>Because of my status being an international student status to a naturalized citizen, I have developed an empathetic view to understanding diverse groups of the population.</br>
      <br>I have aspirations of designing an ideal work environment for those individuals who suffer from cultural transition, homesickness, trauma triggered by unexpected cultural experiences.</br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The research goals of mine are to study about fair staffing, employment law, work-design, relationship between disabilities and employment outcomes.
    </p>
      <p>
        Industrial/Organizational Psychology (I/O Psychology) will be a tool for me to carry out my goals. I am learning and developing knowledge in the field to apply in future work. I've been working as <b>an undergraduate research assistant</b> at the Work Stress and Recovery Lab and C.O.R.E Lab at Virginia Tech.

    <h3>The set of skills and practice I learn from PTW major is invaluable.</h3>
    <p>
      The knowledge of Professional & Technical Writing (PTW) major trains me to be familiar with technical writing skills for educational scholars.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am working as a content design assistant at the Virginia Tech Libraries and VT Publishing Office. I thank to the developing online class taught by Dr. Lindgren as I learned the skills for the position.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two projects I am currently working on. The first project is called "A Man Among Men" in Algerian Paris, and I use the Scalar tool for designing the website.
    </p>
    <p>The second project is called the SIEA (Southern Industrial Educational Association) project, and I design the website by using HTML and CSS as well as type the provided contents.
