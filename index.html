<p><br>Hello! My name is Soonyoung. I go by either Soon, Soonyoung, or Chloe (my English name). I am originally from <b>Seoul, South Korea</b>, immigrated to the <b>United States in 2011 </b> and became <b>a U.S. citizen in 2018.</b>
<p><br>Because of my status being an international student status to a naturalized citizen, I have an empathetic view to understanding diverse groups of the population.
<p><br>Iâ€™ve been developing aspirations of designing an ideal work environment for those individuals who suffer from cultural shock, homesickness, psychological trauma triggered by different cultural experiences that are unexpected.
<p><br><b>Industrial/Organizational Psychology (I/O Psychology) </b> will be a tool for me to carry out my goals. I am learning and developing knowledge in the field to apply in future work. I work as <b>an undergraduate research assistant</b> at the Work Stress and Recovery lab at Virginia Tech.
<p><br>I am studying <b>Psychology and Professional & Technical Writing (PTW).</b> The knowledge of PTW major leads me to be familiar with the professional writing skills for scholars. I am also working as <b>a content design assistant</b> at the Virginia Tech Libraries.
<p><br>I am working hard as a third-year undergraduate student to be <b>a doctorate student of I/O Psychology for Fall 2020.</b>
<p><br>Please check the <b>Resume</b> tab to see what I've been working on</p>
